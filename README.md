# Overview

As a software Engineer I want to continue improving and making people's life easier, I want to make meaningful things
programs solve real problems.

To reach my goals I want to continue expanding my knowledge, learning new technologies, new platforms, programs to give 
my best performance always that I can, that's why I decided to do a program with a language that I never have used before.

I made scientific calculator using c++, the calculator is able to make different operations, handling errors if the user introduce
inputs that the program can't run for instance introducing characters when numbers are required or operations that aren't in the 
calculator, I decided to use polymorphism to put in practice objected oriented programming, a concept I haven't used too much, and it is very handful, I made a super class called operation from where all the other classes(the children) will inherith a method that will be override from every operation, likewise, each class should have a header file to make the compiler life more easier to run the program.

I made this program because I found it interesting if I approch it in a different way like I did it, and also I good first program to learn c++ concepts and syntaxt

# Development Environment

I have used variables, a map, classes, functions, polymorphism, inheritance, loops, conditionals, memory handling, error handling, headers, super classes

I have used C++ as programming language, it is one of the most widely used languages in software development, powering operating systems, embedded systems, game engines, and high-performance applications; The libraries I used a part for the classes I had to import were iostream, map, limits and cmath.

# Future Work

- This language is a very extensive language with many functionalities, I have to continue reading how to use its libraries and the things I can make with it.
- I can make a GUI with the calculator to give the user a better experience
- I could add more functionalities to the calculator like cube root, logarithm, etc...
